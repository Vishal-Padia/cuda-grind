# cuda-grind

Here's are the goals:
1. Understand basic things like back of my hand
2. Start doing GPU puzzles on [LeetGPU](https://www.leetgpu.com)
3. Try to improve inference speed of Sync's Model (super hard but needs to be done)
4. Surpass a Llama.cpp benchmark (super hard but needs to be done)
5. Also while doing doing this, try to be public about it
6. Implement all the transformer blocks in triton
7. Implement Llama in triton 

Once this is done, keep iterating over and over till mastered
